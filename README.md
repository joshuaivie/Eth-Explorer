# Book Store

> The Book Store Application is a front end application build using React and Redux. In this project I explore the use of functional components, component lifecycle, event handling, lifting state and react hooks and redux for state management. The application allows users to display a list of books, add a book and remove a selected book.

> I hope you enjoy this one!
